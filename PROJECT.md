# Test Project

This is a test repository created to verify that Claude can work autonomously on GitHub issues. The project demonstrates Claude's ability to understand issue descriptions, implement requested changes, and interact with GitHub workflows without human intervention.

## How it works

- **Create an issue**: A user creates a GitHub issue and mentions @claude with specific instructions for what needs to be done.
- **Claude works**: Claude analyzes the issue, implements the requested changes, commits them to a new branch, and prepares a pull request.
- **Review and merge**: The user reviews Claude's changes in the pull request and merges them if they meet the requirements.
